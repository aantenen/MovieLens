```

## Introduction

This report details attempts to create a model for predicting user movie ratings based on the MovieLens dataset. Based on the massive size of data options for models were limited. 

##Data validation and cleansing

First validated that there are no blank values. All values in datasets are present. 

Then validate that all values are valid and make sense.

```{r}
plot(allEffectRegularRMSES)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
